# My Python Projects

Welcome to my repository containing five Python projects. Each project focuses on a different aspect of programming and showcases my skills and interests. Feel free to explore and check out other repos. 

## Project 1: The Calculator

This Python calculator project handles basic arithmetic, advanced math functions, and more. Users input two numbers, and the program performs operations based on their choice.

### Usage
For the most part this was an easy project to code. Got stumed for a sec on test cases but figured it out. 

### Issues
Unlike my other projects this one was not that hard to make. 

## Project 2: Terminal Game

This python project has the user play through a series of challenges. defeating enemies and collecting coins. 

### Issues/Challenges

Since the game continues until the player dies or all the enemies are defeated there is a problem in storing information along the way, like the coin count and item count. I had some trouble with this but using a global list I got it to work. 

## Project 3: Music Library

This project assignemt had us build a music library in the terminal with many features. It was to paractice using classes, objects, and methods. You can create playlists full of songs that you can also add and more.

### Issues/Challenges
It was challenging to create these classes and have their methods interact. It was hard to transfer information through classes and access them. For me, it was a lot of new syntax and it took me some time and a few rewrites.  

## Project 4: File Decryption program

This was the hardest project of the class, it involved a few steps. In this project we were given a file filled with directories filled with encrypted files, the program must go through each file and decrepit and then collect information about the file and store it. Files can be missing information or have bad information (Email like this “ajksdlhfi” which is invalid) Using the Os module and some help from my professor I figured it out.   
### Issues/Challenges
This was a project I should have diagramed before I started coding. I ended up working myself into a whole and had to restart. In my first attempt I thought I would collect all the encrypted text data in a list and then process it (it failed and had a long run time). In my second attempt, I processed each file and once the file was processed then started on the next one. 

## Project 5: Pixles and Graphing

This project was easier because my professor gave us some started code. After filling in the needed parts of the code I just needed to adjust pixel movements. 

### Issues/Challenges
First time using matplotlib and Ipython libraries.
