# # My Python Projects

Welcome to my repository containing five Python projects. Each project focuses on a different aspect of programming and showcases my skills and interests. Feel free to explore and check out other repos. 

## Project 1: The Calculator

This Python project implements a versatile calculator program capable of performing basic arithmetic operations, advanced mathematical functions, and more. The calculator takes two numeric inputs (integers or floats) from the user and performs operations based on the user's selection.

### Usage

### Issues
Unlike my other projects this one was not that hard to make.
